I am a Ph.D. student at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

Prior to joining Northwestern University, I was a Research Engineer at the [Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/), working closely with Prof. [Yuen Yuen Ang](https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/yuen-yuen-ang/) and [Charles Chang](https://charleschang.me/) since 2023. I completed a dual master's degree in Information Systems and Computer Science at JHU, concentrating in Human Language Technology. I earned my bachelor's degree in Informatics from the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction and Health Informatics. At UCI, I worked with Prof. [Mark Warschauer](https://markwarschauer.com/) and Dr. Dandan Yang in the field of educational technology.

My research broadly centers around Natural Language Processing (NLP), human-centered artificial intelligence (AI), AI agents, and computational social science. I possess practical experience applying AI technologies to diverse fields, including healthcare, education, social media, political science, and civil engineering. With my interdisciplinary academic background, I consider myself a multidisciplinary researcher committed not only to advancing algorithms and technologies but also to responsibly leveraging AI solutions across various domains to positively impact society and minimize potential negative consequences.
