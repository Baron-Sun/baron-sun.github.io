I am a Ph.D. student at the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/), [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), working with Professor [William J. Brady](https://williamjbrady.com/).

Prior to joining Northwestern University, I was a Research Engineer at the [Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/), working closely with Prof. [Yuen Yuen Ang](https://politicalscience.jhu.edu/directory/yuen-yuen-ang/) and [Charles Chang](https://charleschang.me/) since 2023. I completed a dual master's degree in Information Systems and Computer Science at JHU, concentrating in Human Language Technology. I earned my bachelor's degree in Informatics from the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction and Health Informatics. At UCI, I worked with Prof. [Mark Warschauer](https://markwarschauer.com/) and Dr. Dandan Yang in the field of educational technology.

I have published multiple papers in top-tier conferences, including ICLR, NeurIPS, and ACL, where I also serve as a reviewer. My work is highly interdisciplinary, focusing on computational social science and human-centered AI. I apply advanced AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in diverse fields such as Social Psychology, Adaptive Policy Communication and Deep Fake Detection. With my interdisciplinary academic background, I consider myself a multidisciplinary researcher committed not only to advancing algorithms and technologies but also to responsibly leveraging AI solutions across various domains to positively impact society and minimize potential negative consequences.

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.

## 🎯 Personal
While I am dedicated to interdisciplinary research using computational methods, I am equally passionate about life outside the lab. I have been a professional chess player since childhood, consistently ranking in the top three in various provincial and national tournaments. I also held the #1 spot in the Ivy League Championship standings for several years.

I am an avid sports fan, particularly of soccer and basketball, and a die-hard supporter of the San Antonio Spurs. 
I love hiking and exploring the outdoors with my Golden Retriever TP-arguably the friendliest dog in the world.
